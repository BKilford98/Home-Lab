# Home Lab Portfolio

This repository documents my personal home lab environment, built to develop hands-on IT, networking, and security skills while studying for CompTIA Security+.

This lab is a **work in progress** and is being expanded as I continue learning.

## What this portfolio demonstrates
- Design and implementation of a virtualised corporate-style network
- Network segmentation and routing concepts
- Hands-on experience with Windows and Linux systems
- Clear technical documentation and planning
- Commitment to continuous learning

## Current Lab Environment
- Corporate-style network simulated with multiple virtual machines
- Segregated internal network, DMV and guest network
- PFsense used as virtual router/firewall
- Domain controller and vulnerable environment simulated with Metasploitable
- Windows Tiny11 client on internal network
- Lubuntu on guest network

## Planned Next Steps
- Configure Active Directory Domain Services
- Implement basic Group Policies and user management
- Add monitoring, logging, and further security testing scenarios
