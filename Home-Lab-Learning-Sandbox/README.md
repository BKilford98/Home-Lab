# Home Lab Sandbox
This is where I will document and demonstrate my learning of different topics, tools and skills. These small projects are designed to help me along the learning process by giving me hands-on experience in a safe environment
where I can experiment safely and freely.

> Note: Any notes here are to demonstrate my learning and understanding of the topics shown, they are not a representation of my documenting skills. Furthermore due to the nature of this section and as my learning is ongoing, everything shown
 is subject to mistakes / misunderstandings.
