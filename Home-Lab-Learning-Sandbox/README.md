# Home Lab Sandbox
This section documents my hands-on learning across networking, security, and systems administration.
Each project focuses on practical experimentation with real tools and concepts, using a controlled home-lab environment to explore how technologies behave in practice.

The purpose of these labs is to:

- Deepen my understanding of networking and security concepts

- Experiment with tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, pfSense, and Linux

- Analyse real traffic and system behaviour

- Build practical skills through structured experimentation

## Tools & Topics Covered

- Networking: TCP/IP, subnets, VLANs, firewall rules, NAT

- Security: Nmap scanning techniques, traffic analysis, attack surface mapping

- Tools: Kali Linux, Wireshark, pfSense, Linux (Ubuntu/Lubuntu), VirtualBox

- Concepts: segmentation, filtering, packet analysis, port states, firewall behaviour

> The notes and write-ups reflect my learning process and technical reasoning at the time of each project.
As with any evolving technical work, approaches and interpretations may improve over time as my knowledge develops.
