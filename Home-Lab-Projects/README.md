# Home Lab Projects
This is where I will document my home lab projects and demonstrate my learning. These small projects are designed to help me along the learning process by giving me hands-on experience in a safe environment
where I can experiment safely and freely.

> Note: Any documentation here is purely to show my learning and understanding of topics. They are not meant as a demonstration of my documentation skills.
